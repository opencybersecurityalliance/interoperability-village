# 🏘️ OCA Interoperability Village

> A distributed, community-driven lab for testing and proving interoperability across open, commercial, and emerging cybersecurity tools and frameworks.

![Welcome to the Interoperability Village](A_digital_illustration_titled_%22Welcome_to_the_Inte.png)

---

## 🌐 Introduction

The **Interoperability Village** answers a critical need in cybersecurity: **a persistent, neutral, and flexible environment to test and validate interoperability** between diverse tools and frameworks.

In an era of increasingly complex security ecosystems, no single tool can stand alone. **Interoperability is essential**—and yet testing often happens in isolation, constrained by proprietary infrastructure and limited collaboration.

This project breaks down those silos.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Interoperability Village (IoV)** is a sub-project of the [Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA)](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/), under the **Cyber Automation Sub-Project (CASP)**. It serves as a vendor-neutral playground for:

- Open source tools  
- Commercial cybersecurity frameworks  
- Reference implementations of emerging standards  

Our mission: **enable real-world, hands-on interoperability testing** through a flexible, distributed, and community-supported lab architecture.

---

## 🧪 Key Use Cases

- Test integrations between **OASIS standards**, open-source, and commercial tools  
- Develop and refine **reference implementations**  
- Host **quarterly Plugfests** for live collaboration and demonstration  
- Provide a **safe, isolated, disposable** testing environment for rapid prototyping  

> ⚙️ *Build. Break. Iterate. Interoperate.*

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives

- 🔁 **Persistence** – Retain knowledge, data, and tooling across iterations  
- 🧩 **Flexibility** – Raspberry Pi to high-end clusters—build your lab your way  
- 💸 **Low Cost** – Minimal infrastructure and support overhead  
- ☁️ **Centrally Provisioned** – MeshCentral on AWS for global reach  
- 🏗️ **Ephemeral Labs** – Spin up one-off "Villages" on demand  
- 🔐 **Risk-Commensurate Security** – Segmented, external-only access  
- 🕸️ **Mesh Architecture** – Distributed, scalable, and resilient  

---

## 🏡 Architecture: "The Village"

### 🏢 Central HQ (AWS)

The **IoV Central Hub**—also known as the *Town Council* and *Zoning Commission*—runs a central instance of [MeshCentral](https://meshcentral.com/downloads.html) on AWS, acting as the provisioning and orchestration backbone.

### 🧱 Neighborhoods & Huts

- A **Neighborhood** is your logical domain (lab, subnet, enclave).  
- A **Hut** is any system, VM, container, or device you provision.  
- From a $80 Raspberry Pi to a fleet of NVIDIA RTX Blackwell nodes—**bring what you've got**.

You bring your **public IP and ACL**, we provide an **Agent Provisioning Script**. That’s it.

---

## 🧰 Hardware & Tooling

We've had excellent results using:

- **Raspberry Pi 5** (16GB RAM) with NVMe SSD + 5TB SATA  
- **Docker** for container orchestration  
- **Ansible** for provisioning  
- **MeshCentral** for remote control and central coordination  

### Supported Frameworks

- [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/)  
- [OpenCTI](https://www.opencti.io/)  
- [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/)  
- [OpenBAS](https://www.openbas.io/)  
- Dozens of **Connectors** and integrations  

> If it runs in a Docker container, it runs in IoV.

---

## 🧪 Plug-and-Play Testing

- 🔄 Rapid prototyping outside internal security gates  
- ⏱️ Quick spin-up/tear-down cycles  
- 🧬 Persistent test states for iterative development  
- ☁️ Deploy anywhere: home lab, cloud, enterprise  

---

## 🗓️ Community Engagement

To grow the Village, we focus on:

- 🤝 **Stakeholder Engagement** – Incorporating OCA community feedback  
- 💼 **Sponsor Outreach** – Demonstrating value to funders and backers  
- 🧑‍💻 **Volunteer Recruitment** – Tapping the talent of the security ecosystem  
- 📈 **Progress Transparency** – Frequent updates to the OCA leadership & sponsors  
- 🔌 **Quarterly Plugfests** – Real-world demos with stakeholders, tools, and standards
